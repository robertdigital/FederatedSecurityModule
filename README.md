# A Federated Approach to Identifying Advanced Persistent Security Threats on Enterprise Computer Networks

Public project web repository for an [Integration Project](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/comp/comp697_698_699syllabus.php) at [Athabasca University](https://www.athabascau.ca/).  This will serve as the official central repository of project documents, deliverables, and source code.

## Project Overview

Computer Security is an intense flash point of concern in the modern computing landscape. Many threats to computer systems both known and unknown prey on the mind of computer professionals.  Advanced Persistent Security Threats (APST) are a species of clandestine attack which infiltrate computer systems to exfiltrate data and struggle to maintain an everlasting foothold inside the target network. They are of particular concern thanks to their use and sponsorship by state actors in proxy battles and covert operations. In this landscape we chart the rise of the threat and search for free and open source software which can be used on an enterprise network to detect the threat. Uncovering the threat will be a collaboration between the security tools cooperating together as components within a Federated Security Module (FSM) built using the [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) (ELK) Stack. A federation between [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/), [Snort](https://www.snort.org/), [Sweet Security](https://github.com/TravisFSmith/SweetSecurity) ([Zeek](https://www.bro.org/zeek.html)), [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) ([OSSEC](https://www.ossec.net/)), and [Honeytrap](https://github.com/honeytrap/) will offer a centralized data source from which their combined knowledge can be accessed. The efficacy of the federation will be evaluated using a test suite on a simulated enterprise network to provide us with opportunities for improvement and lessons learned for future research.
